# 02326 Algorithms and Data Structures Notes

These are my personal notes for the course **02326 Algorithms and Data Structures** at DTU. You are welcome to use these notes for studying, reference, or as a starting point for your own learning. Contributions and suggestions are also welcome!

These notes are structured for use with [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), a free note taking app. You can use them as a regular folder of Markdown files, but using Obsidian is recommended for better navigation and linking between notes.

> Note: I will not be adding the rest of the lecture notes due to pressure in regards to time (studying for exams), however, every idea discussed in each lecture will be available in the atomic notes

You have two main options for using these notes:

1. **Simple Download**: Download and use the notes as-is (no updates)

## Keeping Your Vault Updated

If you used the **Fork & Sync** method, you can regularly pull updates from the original repository while keeping your personal notes.

### Step 1: Commit Your Personal Changes

Before updating, always commit your personal notes:

```bash
# Add your changes
git add .
git commit -m "Add my personal notes"
git push origin main
```

### Step 2: Fetch and Merge Updates

```bash
# Fetch latest changes from the original repository
git fetch upstream

# Merge the updates into your fork
git merge upstream/main

# Push the updates to your fork
git push origin main
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

If you've modified the same files that were updated in the original repository, you may encounter merge conflicts:

1. Git will mark conflicted files
2. Open the files in Obsidian or a text editor
3. Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<`, `======`, `>>>>>>`)
4. Choose which version to keep or combine both
5. Remove the conflict markers
6. Commit the resolved conflicts:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Resolve merge conflicts"
   git push origin main
   ```
